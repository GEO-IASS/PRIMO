PRIMO - PRobabilistic Inference MOdules
========

This is a probabilistic inference module for Python. The aim 
of this project is to create a library which offers well known
probabilistic (graphical) models like Bayesian or temporal networks.
A variety of inference algorithms will be implemented soon.
