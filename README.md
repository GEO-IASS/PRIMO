PRIMO - PRobabilistic Inference MOdules
========

This project contains probabilistic inference modules for Python. Our aim is to create a library which offers well known
probabilistic (graphical) models like Bayesian or temporal networks.
A variety of inference algorithms will be implemented soon.
